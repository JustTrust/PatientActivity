Patient activity
================

If you want to be in good shape, this app will help you.
The application works in the background and will calculate your activity in the last six hours.
Simple indicator shows how much you move.
If you walk or run or ride a bike, the indicator will move to green.
If you do not move or travel by car, the indicator will move to the red.
Red is bad! Green is good!
